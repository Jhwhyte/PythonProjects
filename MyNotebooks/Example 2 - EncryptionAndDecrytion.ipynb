And your positive action combined with positive thinking results in success. Just as Your positive action combined with positive thinking results in success. Some people dream of success, while other people get up every morning and make it happen. Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success. Ultimately, leadership is not about glorious crowning acts. It's about keeping your team focused on a goal and motivated to do their best to achieve it, especially when the stakes are high and the consequences really matter. It is about laying the groundwork for others' success, and then standing back and letting them shine. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success.

Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. To be a champion, I think you have to see the big picture. It's not about winning and losing; it's about every day hard work and about thriving on a challenge. It's about embracing the pain that you'll experience at the end of a race and not being afraid. I think people think too hard and get afraid of a certain challenge. All life demands struggle. Those who have everything given to them become lazy, selfish, and insensitive to the real values of life. The very striving and hard work that we so constantly try to avoid is the major building block in the person we are today.\"\n",

Whatever you go into, you have to go in there to be the best. There's no formulas. It's all about passion and honesty and hard work. It might look glamorous, but it takes a lot of hard work. The blessing with the arts is that you can do it forever. If four things are followed - having a great aim, acquiring knowledge, hard work, and perseverance - then anything can be achieved. A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. The basic skills of leaders are always the same: be driven by a deeper purpose, be a human being, have a passion for what you do, and it's also about hard work and ethics. Respect your parents. What they tell you is true. Hard work, dedication and faith will get you anything. Imagination will drive itself. You can get anything you want, but you have to have faith behind all your ideas. Stick to your goals and have an undying faith. Self-belief and hard work will always earn you success. Hard work without talent is a shame, but talent without hard work is a tragedy.\"\n",

      "Hi! Glad to have you as a team mate! my name is James Whyte and I am part of your team in GEOG476. My interests include mathematics, programming, data science, statistics, art, and music. As a hobby I enjoy playing the guitar, sleeping, and drinking green tea. My major is geospatial information science and computer cartography. My expected graduation is December 2018. My goal for this class is to become more proficient in geospatial data analysis, collection, and visualization by the medium of python programming. I hope to gain the skills needed for companies such as NASA, Census bureau, SPACE-X, and the like. I think you will add great value to the team with your skills. A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do. Without hard work, nothing grows but weeds. Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. To be a champion, I think you have to see the big picture. It's not about winning and losing; it's about every day hard work and about thriving on a challenge. It's about embracing the pain that you'll experience at the end of a race and not being afraid. I think people think too hard and get afraid of a certain challenge. All life demands struggle. Those who have everything given to them become lazy, selfish, and insensitive to the real values of life. The very striving and hard work that we so constantly try to avoid is the major building block in the person we are today."

      "Greetings there! my name is James Whyte and I am part of your team in GEOG476. My interests include mathematics, programming, data science, statistics, art, and music.

I hope to gain the skills needed for companies such as NASA, Census bureau, SPACE-X, and the like. I think you will add great value to the team with your skills. Whatever you go into, you have to go in there to be the best. There's no formulas. It's all about passion and honesty and hard work. It might look glamorous, but it takes a lot of hard work. The blessing with the arts is that you can do it forever. If four things are followed - having a great aim, acquiring knowledge, hard work, and perseverance - then anything can be achieved. A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. The basic skills of leaders are always the same: be driven by a deeper purpose, be a human being, have a passion for what you do, and it's also about hard work and ethics. Respect your parents. What they tell you is true. Hard work, dedication and faith will get you anything. Imagination will drive itself. You can get anything you want, but you have to have faith behind all your ideas. Stick to your goals and have an undying faith. Self-belief and hard work will always earn you success. Hard work without talent is a shame, but talent without hard work is a tragedy."
